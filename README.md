### Oh Hello there,

My name is Tumur(Tim), and I am an Android developer. I was born and grew up in Mongolia, and I studied Computer Science in Germany. I currently live in the San Francisco Bay Area.

In the last four years, I have been working on personal projects and published three apps on the Google Play store.

In my free time, I’ve been running in the park and watching documentary movies.

If you’d like to get in touch, I’m at <a href="mailto:timtb@hey.com">timtb@hey.com</a>
